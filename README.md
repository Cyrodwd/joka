# Joka

Joka is a simple nogc utility library for the D programming language.
It provides data structures and functions that work without garbage collection, offering precise memory control and minimal runtime overhead.

> This is alpha software. Use it only if you are very cool.

## Attributes and BetterC Support

This project offers support for some attributes (`@safe`, `@nogc`, `nothrow`) and aims for good compatibility with BetterC.

## Web Support

Since this project does not rely on the D standard library, it can be used with Emscripten to compile and export to the web.

## Note

I add things to Joka when I need them.

## License
